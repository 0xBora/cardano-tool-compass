## Getting Started ðŸš€

This is Next project that generates static pages based on `.mmd` file and `yml` files

To start development mode run:
```
npm install
npm run dev

# goto http://localhost:3000
```

To build static pages run: `npm run build` generated files can be find in `/out` directory

## Mermaid structure ðŸ§¬

Flow chart is generated based on `questionnaire.mmd` file.

### Behaviour:

- **Blocks with external links** automatically redirect users to external page. For example `https://github.com`
- **Blocks with relative links** point to directories in `/storage/solutions`. For example `java` will point to `/storage/solutions/java`. This block will display solutions page with technologies stored in `.yml` files in `/storage/solutions/java` directory

## YML files

Additional data is stored in yml files.

If you want to add additional data to a mermaid block just add `[mermaidBlockId].yml` to `/storage/questions`

**The block yml** file accepts:
- pros: string[]
- cons: string[]
- usuallyUsed: string[]
- toolsAndUseCases: {title: string, text: string}[]

If you want to add information about solutions just add `[technologyName].yml` to `/storage/questions/[technology]` and link it in `.mmd` file

**The solution yml** file accepts:
- name: string
- description: string
- pros: string[]
- cons: string[]
- url: string

## Environment file ðŸŒ±
In .env file you can specify:

- **FIRST_QUESTION_URL** - should point to the first question. This is used to automatically redirect user to first question when he enter `index.html` and is also used on `Start over` button 
- **CLOSE_URL** - should point to cardano-foundation page I set it to `https://cardanofoundation.org/ledger-sync`. It is used when user clicks `X` button in the top navigation
